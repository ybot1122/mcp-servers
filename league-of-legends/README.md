Using the localhost endpoint that is available when you are playing a League of Legends game, this MCP server retrieves data about your current state of the game.

There is also a tool to retrieve a summary of a summoner's match history (last 10 matches). This can be useful for understanding which of your teammates are playing their main roles or struggling with a losing streak.
